                <h1>🧠 From Notebook to Pipeline: A Deep Learning Developer's Journey (Part 1)</h1>

<p>Every machine learning project starts with a spark of an idea. Mine was simple: "Could I build a model to tell the difference between pizza, steak, and sushi?" Like many developers, I opened my go-to tool for exploration: a Jupyter Notebook. It felt like the perfect place to start, but I quickly discovered that a notebook is just a starting point. The real journey—the one filled with frustrating setbacks and "aha!" moments—was turning that experimental script into a reliable, reusable machine learning system.</p>

<h3>The First Big Question: Is My Model Actually Any Good?</h3>

<p>After some initial coding, I had a simple classifier that seemed to work. But my process was a mess. I was manually changing hyperparameters in code cells, re-running the notebook, and scribbling results in a notepad. I was getting numbers, but I couldn't trust them. This led to the first major challenge: <strong>how can I prove my model's performance in a scientific, repeatable way?</strong></p>

<p>This single question broke down into a series of smaller, interconnected problems.</p>

<p><strong>Problem #1: My experiments were chaotic and biased.</strong>
My first attempt at a solution was to bring order to the chaos. I wrote a nested loop to systematically iterate through every combination of model (<code>EfficientNetB0</code>, <code>B2</code>, <code>B4</code>), dataset size, and training duration.</p>

<p><img src="posts_assets/experiments-table.png" alt="A table showing the structured plan for all 8 experiments, varying model type, data size, and epochs." />
<em>Moving from random tweaks to a structured experiment plan like this was the first step toward building a reliable model.</em></p>

<p>This was a huge step forward! But it created a new problem: I was drowning in a sea of <code>print()</code> statements. Comparing the results of run #3 with run #17 was a nightmare of scrolling and squinting.</p>

<pre><code># The first step toward a real system: a structured experiment loop
for data_name, train_dataloader in train_dataloaders_dict.items():
    for epochs in num_epochs_list:
        for model_name in models_list:
            # ... train and evaluate ...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Problem #2: I couldn't visualize the story of my training.</strong>
I realized I didn't just need results; I needed a narrative. I needed to see the learning curves to understand <em>how</em> each model was behaving. This is where TensorBoard came in. But my first attempt was, again, a mess. All my logs were jumbled into one confusing timeline.</p>

<p><img src="posts_assets/tensorboard-accuracy-chart.png" alt="A screenshot of the TensorBoard dashboard showing accuracy curves for multiple experiments." />
<em>TensorBoard made it easy to visually compare all eight experiments. The superiority of the <code>EffNetB2</code> model trained on 20% of the data (the top-performing line) became immediately obvious.</em></p>

<p>The insight wasn't just to <em>use</em> TensorBoard, but to be deliberate about <em>how</em> I organized my logs. I wrote a small utility function to create a clean, timestamped directory structure for every single run, which made the above visualization possible.</p>

<pre><code># This function was the key to unlocking readable, comparable logs
def create_writer(experiment_name, model_name, extra=None):
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    log_dir = Path("runs") / timestamp / experiment_name / model_name
    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I could see the story. I had a dashboard that clearly showed which models were learning fastest and which were overfitting. The data was now pointing to <code>EfficientNetB2</code> as the most promising candidate.</p>

<h3>The Second Big Question: How Do I Squeeze Out More Performance?</h3>

<p>My experiments were now reliable, but the best model's accuracy was still just "okay." I knew the answer was <strong>Transfer Learning</strong>, but I soon learned that knowing the name of a technique is very different from implementing it correctly.</p>

<p><img src="posts_assets/feature-extraction-diagram.png" alt="A diagram showing a large pre-trained model being adapted for a new, smaller task." />
<em>The core concept of feature extraction: keep the pre-trained 'backbone' (the feature learner) and only train a new, small 'head' (the classifier) on our specific data.</em></p>

<p><strong>Problem #3: My GPU was crying and my training was slow.</strong>
My first attempt was naive. I loaded a pre-trained <code>EfficientNet</code>, swapped the final layer for my 3-class classifier, and hit "train." My GPU fan spun up like a jet engine, and the estimated training time was in hours, not minutes.</p>

<p>The "aha!" moment came after digging into how transfer learning truly works. I was trying to retrain the entire network. The solution was to <strong>freeze the backbone</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="posts_assets/torchinfo-frozen-layers.png" alt="A screenshot of the torchinfo summary showing a massive reduction in trainable parameters." />
<em>The proof is in the numbers. After freezing the backbone, the number of trainable parameters dropped from over 4 million to just 3,843, dramatically speeding up training.</em></p>

<pre><code># The crucial insight: only train the tiny new part of the model
for param in model.features.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False # Freeze the billions of learned parameters
</code></pre>

<p>By freezing the vast majority of the network, I was only training the tiny "head" I had added. The training time plummeted, and my GPU could finally breathe.</p>

<p><strong>Problem #4: A better model was performing worse. Why?</strong>
With my training loop now fast and efficient, I hit another wall. My accuracy was inexplicably poor. I spent hours debugging my code before realizing the problem wasn't in my logic, but in my data.</p>

<p>The pre-trained <code>EfficientNet</code> model expects images to be a specific size, with specific normalization values. My manually crafted image transforms were close, but not perfect. It was like speaking the same language but with a slightly wrong accent—the model was getting confused. The fix, once found, was beautifully simple:</p>

<pre><code># This one line fixed a mountain of hidden data-mismatch issues
weights = torchvision.models.EfficientNet_B0_Weights.DEFAULT
auto_transforms = weights.transforms()
</code></pre>

<p>Using the transforms that came packaged with the pre-trained weights ensured my data was perfectly preened for the model and the accuracy immediately jumped.</p>

<h3>The Final Step: From a Monolithic Script to a Modular System</h3>

<p>I now had a reliable, high-performing pipeline. But it was all trapped inside a single, massive 500-line script. It worked, but it wasn't a piece of software; it was a monolith.</p>

<p>The final challenge of this phase was to perform the <strong>Great Refactor</strong>. I systematically broke the monolithic script apart, piece by piece, into a dedicated Python package called <code>food_vision</code>. Each file was given a single, clear responsibility:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>data_setup.py</code>: Does one thing: creates <code>DataLoaders</code>.</li>
<li><code>model_builder.py</code>: Does one thing: builds <code>EfficientNet</code> models.</li>
<li><code>engine.py</code>: Does one thing: runs the training and testing loops.</li>
<li><code>utils.py</code>: Holds the helpers for saving models and creating TensorBoard writers.</li>
</ul>

<p>This process was the bridge from being a data scientist to being an MLOps engineer. The result wasn't just a script that ran; it was a <strong>system</strong> that could be imported, tested, and extended.</p>

<p>The ML brain was finally complete. It was validated, packaged, and ready. But it was a brain trapped in a jar, only accessible via my terminal. It felt like a powerful engine with no car around it. The next, even bigger challenge was giving it a body—an interactive web interface that anyone could use.</p>

<p>My struggle with web frameworks, background processes, and user experience is a whole other story. <strong>If you want to see how I built the UI for this model, you can follow along in <a href="posts/from-notebook-to-ui-the-web-deployment-journey-part-2.html">Part 2 of this series</a>!</strong></p>
